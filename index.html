    <h1 class="box1">Welcome to Khety Land!</h1>
    <h3 class="box3">Hi! My name's Khety as you can tell by the header. And this is one of my first pages using HTML and CSS. This is going to be a sort of experimental page where I keep updating it everytime I learn something new about CSS and web design in general. So everytime you see this it'll be a little bit different and hopefully a little bit better everytime. So enjoy!
                    This is also going to be a blog! I hope that this might help someone that's trying to learn CSS, HTML, Javascript or anything Web Design. Or maybe that this will help anyone to find inspiration because that was also something that I stuggled with a lot at the beginning. Or that it'll just serve as entertainment for someone that's trying to learn these things and just wants to procrastinate a little bit but still doesn't just want to watch youtube or netflix or something like that.

        <h3>Hi! So this is my first blog! I'm going to be be explaining the main things that I've learned so far. So far this is what my blog page looks like: <img src="2021-05-10 (2).png" class="img">
        So as you can see the page contains a simple header saying "Welcome to Khety Land", two images/gifs that are on the side, and a body that contains a few words about who I am and what this page is about. Simple right? Well, as you can see, right now there is also a "button" that opens up the blog and closes it (by the way you close the blog by double clicking the "button" and you'll see why I double quote the button later on. Also, if you're dumb enough to ask yourself "Well, how do I open it?"
         then this is probably not for you) but that doesn't show up in the screenshot because that screenshot was taken yesturday. Anyway, one of the main things that I'm going to show step-by-step how to make is: (drum roll) the little button thingy! (I don't know what to call it in tech-y terms). The main reason I want to show how to make the button thingy is because I stuggled with that for almost two days! It might not be much compared to people that have been designing for years or maybe even 
         just a few months and since I've been doing this for almost a week the most I've been stuck on something is about 2 days. Anyways, here's how to make the button thingy! So the first thing I'm going explain step-by-step is the HTML of the button thingy. The main reason I want to explain that one first is just because the javascript and css of this is all based on the HTML. So here we have the HTML code: <img src="buttonhtml.png" class="img2"> So as you can see the first thing that is very important to have
        in your code is structure. It is neccesary in almost every programming and in some even mandatory. So right here the structure is class#1 which is in a div and it is called box 4, this class is just to bring together the button and the text that will drop-down. The next element is an h3 element which is the button, then there's the last class which is panel and that one contains this text right here. As you can see it is indented accordingly but if you don't know what indenting is then here is a good explaination about what it is and why it's neccesary so just
      <a href="https://www.quora.com/What-is-indentation-in-programming-and-why-is-it-needed">click here</a> I'll explain how the HTML code works in a moment.</h3> <h3>So after structure comes the actual code, right? Correct! So now I'm going to explain everything that's related to the code part of the button <img src="buttonjs.png" class="img3"> That right there is the Javascript of the button. This is very basic and simple Javascript but if you're confused on how it works, it basically just says if you click the button change the panel style to block which means show. The button is automatically set to display:none; in the CSS code: <img src="buttoncss.png" class="img4"> The rest of the CSS code is pretty simple but if you don't know what it means yet don't worry! It's actually pretty easy to understand even without knowing code. The text-align basically is defining where in that block you want to align it (left, right, and center) if there is a part
        that really confuses you, you can go <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp">here</a>
      So, like I said the CSS code is pretty simple, but those few lines are very important because if you use those lines wisely you can create a pretty beautiful button. Do I consider my button beautiful? No, not really. Do I consider to be a little easier on the eyes compared to before? Yeah. And getting back to the HTML part of the button, the indentation should be 1- The first div/ class (name it however you want) 2- Another class saying that if the area of the class is clicked run MyFunction() or whatever you choose to name your function 3- Next is an ID that contains an h3 tag that has all the text that you want to hide/show 4- And put all of that in the body</h3><h3>
        So that's how my code works! I hope you that you enjoyed this blog and I hope this can help some people that are starting out or that just want some entertainment that's not completely dumb and useless. And hopefully I can look back at this and see my progress!
