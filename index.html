    <h1 class="box1">Welcome to Khety Land!</h1>
    <h3 class="box3">Hi! My name's Khety as you can tell by the header. And this is one of my first pages using HTML and CSS. This is going to be a sort of experimental page where I keep updating it everytime I learn something new about CSS and web design in general. So everytime you see this it'll be a little bit different and hopefully a little bit better everytime. So enjoy!
                    This is also going to be a blog! I hope that this might help someone that's trying to learn CSS, HTML, Javascript or anything Web Design. Or maybe that this will help anyone to find inspiration because that was also something that I stuggled with a lot at the beginning. Or that it'll just serve as entertainment for someone that's trying to learn these things and just wants to procrastinate a little bit but still doesn't just want to watch youtube or netflix or something like that.

        <h3>Hi! So this is my first blog! I'm going to be be explaining the main things that I've learned so far. So far this is what my blog page looks like: <img src="2021-05-10 (2).png" class="img">
        So as you can see the page contains a simple header saying "Welcome to Khety Land", two images/gifs that are on the side, and a body that contains a few words about who I am and what this page is about. Simple right? Well, as you can see, right now there is also a "button" that opens up the blog and closes it (by the way you close the blog by double clicking the "button" and you'll see why I double quote the button later on. Also, if you're dumb enough to ask yourself "Well, how do I open it?"
         then this is probably not for you) but that doesn't show up in the screenshot because that screenshot was taken yesturday. Anyway, one of the main things that I'm going to show step-by-step how to make is: (drum roll) the little button thingy! (I don't know what to call it in tech-y terms). The main reason I want to show how to make the button thingy is because I stuggled with that for almost two days! It might not be much compared to people that have been designing for years or maybe even 
         just a few months and since I've been doing this for almost a week the most I've been stuck on something is about 2 days. Anyways, here's how to make the button thingy! So the first thing I'm going explain step-by-step is the HTML of the button thingy. The main reason I want to explain that one first is just because the javascript and css of this is all based on the HTML. So here we have the HTML code: <img src="buttonhtml.png" class="img2"></h3>
